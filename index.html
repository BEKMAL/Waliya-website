               <p class="each_title">Hire purchase products</p>
               <p>From a product perspective, two types of products are licensed to lease in Ethiopia (i.e. Hire purchase & Financial lease). However, currently, the Company is practicing hire purchasing that allowed to transfer full ownership to the enterprise (lessee) at the end of the lease period. Due, the MSMEs are interested in this type of products to be leased. Also hire purchase is very tailored for MSMEs because it is a type of leasing of capital goods finance by which a lesser provides a lessee with the use of specified capital goods, against payment of mutually agreed installments over a specified period of time, with each lease payment, an equal percentage of the owner ship is transferred to the lessee on the last payment, the ownership of capital goods transferred to the lessees.</p>
               <p>We are offering on the following sectors in hire purchase</p>
